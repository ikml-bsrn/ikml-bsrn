## Hello! 👋

I'm Ikmal, a second-year Data Science student passionate about solving real-world problems with ethical, data-driven solutions.

I focus on goal-oriented decision-making: asking the right questions, using the right tools, and continuously improving along the way. Whether it's building predictive models, analysing messy datasets, or exploring image classification, I'm all about learning and creating value with data.

### 🛠️ What I work with:
- **Database design & data modeling**
- **Machine Learning** - regression, classification, ensemble models
- **Deep Learning** - image classification (YOLOv5, v8, v11)
- **Python**, **SQL**, **Pandas**, **scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, **Ultralytics**, and more

### 🚧 Projects in Progress
- **NYC Transportation Demand Forecasting**  
  Live dashboard + API integrations for For-Hire Vehicles (FHV) demand prediction.

### ✨ Recent Highlights
- Led a **YOLO-based human detection** project for wilderness search and rescue (WiSAR)
- Explored **model comparison** using NYC trip data (Linear, RF, XGBoost, DL)

### 🌱 Currently:
- Expanding my project portfolio
- Actively seeking **Summer 2025 Data Science Internship** opportunities
- Strengthening my Python, data analysis, and machine learning skills
  through hands-on practice and deeper exploration
