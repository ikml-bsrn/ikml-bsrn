## Hello! 👋

I'm Ikmal, a penultimate-year Data Science student at The University of Sheffield, passionate about solving real-world problems with ethical, data-driven solutions.

I like to focus on goal-oriented decision-making, meaning asking the right questions for a problem, using the right tools, and continuously improving along the way. Whether it's building predictive models, analysing messy datasets, or creating the best dashboard, I'm all about learning and creating value with data.

### 🛠️ What I work with:
- **Database design & data modeling**
- **Python**, **SQL**, **Pandas**, **scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, **Ultralytics**, and more
- **Data Visualisation** - Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning** - regression, classification, ensemble models
- **Deep Learning** - image classification (YOLOv5, v8, v11)


### 🚧 Projects in Progress
- **NYC Transportation Demand Forecasting**  
  Dashboard + API integrations for transportation demand prediction.

### ✨ Recent Highlights
- Led a **YOLO-based human detection** project for wilderness search and rescue (WiSAR).
- Built and evaluated **tree-based (Random Forest, XGBoost) and
  deep learning (Tensorflow) models** using real-world NYC trip data
  and historical weather data using Open-Meteo API.

### 🌱 Currently:
- Expanding my project portfolio
- Actively seeking **Summer 2025 Data Science Internship** opportunities
- Strengthening my Python, data cleaning, and machine learning skills
  through hands-on practice and deeper exploration
