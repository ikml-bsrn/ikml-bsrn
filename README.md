## Hello! 👋

I'm Ikmal, a final-year Data Science student at The University of Sheffield, passionate about solving real-world problems with data-driven solutions.

I like to focus on goal-oriented decision-making, meaning asking the right questions for a problem, using the right tools, and continuously improving along the way. Whether it's building agentic AI systems for workflow automation, predictive modelling, analysing messy datasets, or creating the dashboards, I'm all about learning and creating value with data.
